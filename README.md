This repository is part of the xAI-Proj-B Bachelor Project on Explainable Machine Learning at the University of Bamberg.

It contains the dataset used for the final test phase.

This document describes the file naming conventions and upload format for our project’s dataset images. It ensures that all team members follow a consistent structure when contributing photos to the final test dataset.

File Naming Format:

Each image must follow this naming convention:

studentID_phoneID_classname_imageID.jpg

Example:

ABCABCABC_XX_coffee-mug_001.jpg

Components Explained:

studentID – Unique identifier assigned to each student. phoneID – Short code for the device used to take the photo. Example: XX for iPhone 15, YY for iPhone 16. classname – The object or class in the photo. Example: coffee-mug, notebook. imageID – 3-digit counter representing the image number for that class. Example: 001, 002, 003.

Rules and Notes:

Use “-” to connect words in multi-word class names. Example: coffee-mug, water-bottle, laptop-stand. The phoneID identifies the recording device but does not affect the image numbering for the same class. The imageID acts as the class counter. It increases sequentially for each new image of the same class by the same student.

Example:

ABCABCABC_XX_coffee-mug_001.jpg

ABCABCABC_XX_coffee-mug_002.jpg

ABCABCABC_XX_coffee-mug_003.jpg

When the same student uses different phones, keep the imageID counter consistent for each class across devices.
